# Monday :: The Object model
 Applying the "Open class" spell it's a nice and dangerous thing at the same time. We could think about *class* keyword more like **scope operator** than a simple keyword to define classes. Even being very dangerous to open a class, several ruby libraries (like money) open some core classes to let us use them more naturally. You will also find mokeypatch as synonyms for open class, both in a good way and bad way too. Think of it like a *GLOBAL MODIFICATION*, so you will be more warned!

## Points
 * think twice, think again about use open class spell.
 * instance variables are not connected to the classes.
