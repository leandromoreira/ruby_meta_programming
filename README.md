# Monday :: The Object model
 Applying the "Open class" spell it is a nice and danger thing at the same time. We should think about class keyword more like 'scope operator' than a simple keyword to define classes. Even being very dangerous to open a class, several ruby libraries (like money) open some core classes to let its uses more naturally. You will also find mokeypatch as synonyms for open class, both in a good way and bad way too. Think of it like a GLOBAL MODIFICATION, so you will be more warned!

## Points
 * think twice and rethink about use open class spell
 * instance variables are not connected to the classes
